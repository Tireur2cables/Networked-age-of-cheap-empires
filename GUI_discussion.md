# 1 seule civilisation;
  (14) Civilisation variety.
  AoE games implement a great many civilisations, each with different technology trees,
  bonuses, and unique units (in AoE II).
  As discussed in the overview, I do not advise emulating that. One civilisation is quite
  enough, provided it is a bit versatile.
