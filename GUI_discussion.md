# 1 seule civilisation;
  (14) Civilisation variety.
  AoE games implement a great many civilisations, each with different technology trees,
  bonuses, and unique units (in AoE II).
  As discussed in the overview, I do not advise emulating that. One civilisation is quite
  enough, provided it is a bit versatile.

# Paramètre au démarrage
- Ressources (Bois,Nourriture,Or,Pierre) : à la discrétion de l'user, input chiffre
- Map (5 map différentes dont une aléatoire, les autres sont toujours les mêmes)
  (12) e: More than 2 players.
  The minimum that must be implemented is Human vs AI, and since we eschew
  multiplayer, there is at most one human player. AoE games support up to 8 players.
  You can do the same if you wish. Human vs 7 AI can be fun.
  If you do so, implementing diplomacy to create factions would be relevant.

  If you do that, you will probably need to have different map sizes

  (16) aE: Starting resources.
  You should be able to start a game with varying quantities of resources, not just the
  default. Ideal, you could even tweak this per player, making this a very cheap, but
  very effective way to control game difficulty.
  Letting the AI start with lots of resources can be a good way to showcase its game plan.
