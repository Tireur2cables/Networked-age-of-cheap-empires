# 1) Edit these parameters as you wish so that your game always launch the way you want it
# 2) Never commit changes on this file (except to add lines), so that everyone still has his own version.
# Note: If you add lines, remember to put the default values back before commiting.

# Defaults, in this order: True, True, False, False, False, True, False, False, False, False, False
